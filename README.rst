Panstora will be a Cool Thingâ„¢.

This will be our submission for Hack Upstate (Spring 2013).

This is the project description I submitted:

*Python-powered application for shopping in a unique way. Shoppers visit stores
in busy locations, such as downtown regions. These special stores have only a
few copies of each item they sell, enough to demonstrate the items and let
potential buyers try them out. Users can scan NFC or QR codes with a mobile
device to select the items they want to buy. Checkout occurs on the mobile
device. Items are shipped the same day from a warehouse on the outskirts of
town, where land is much cheaper. This system allows stores to minimalize cost
of land in expensive areas (such as downtown), as well as carry a wider variety
of items, since they all of the bulk is stored in an off-site warehouse. The
benefits of online shopping with the experience of in-store shopping.*

The panstora home view contains nothing of interest to the actual
application process, other than providing a landing page.

The item view is where item details are displayed. This view can
be accessed at ``siteurl.com/item/[item_code]``.
